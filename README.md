# This is a template when creating repositories

Use this repository during the first step of developing a tercen operator (in R) on github.

An overview of steps for developing an operator are:

1. create a github repo
2. install tercen_studio
3. login to tercen_studio
4. git clone the newly created repo
5. start developing in R in tercen_studio
6. add R packages to the repo
7. push to the github repo
8. go to tercen and install the operator

For the first step, while creating the repository, you will notice the option to use a template repository, choose the `templateR_operator` repository and select it as the template repository.

After creation, you now have a new repository with all the convenient files for making a new operator (in R) for tercen.

Use `tercen_studio` to clone the new repository and start programming in `tercen_studio`

it includes the skeleton files 

* `main.R`
* `workspace.R`
* `operator.json`
* `README_template.md`
* `doc` directory

please the README_template.

inside the `doc` there is a `dev_commands.md` file which contains useful development command lines.
